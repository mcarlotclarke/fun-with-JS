    // Let's say we have an array

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log('players', players, 'teams', team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Bob';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // both players and team = ["Don", "Kiki", "Shrimpy", "Bob"]
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Bud';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Don Quijote',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy: (Not this way though)
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 100;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 1500, animal:'horse'});
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // With the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    captain3.animal = 'donkey';
    console.log(person, captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    console.log(player);

    // player.profession.team = 'Dodgers'; // will change the next level's property for original object as well
    // console.log(joeD, player);

    // A "cheap" way to "deep" clone - in this way we are copying all levels and therefore not changing the original
